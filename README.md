# Sales-Dashboard
The E-commerce Sales Dashboards project aimed to provide comprehensive insights into e-commerce sales performance through interactive and visually appealing dashboards developed using Power BI. Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data. Used Complex Parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers. Created connections, joined new tables, and used calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations. The project analyzed and monitored key metrics such as profit, order volume, customer demographics, product performance, and sales trends. By leveraging data from e-commerce sales data, the dashboards enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, identify growth opportunities, and track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.


The dashboard is organized by quarter, state, and sub-category, so we can easily filter and drill down into specific areas of interest. For example, we can see how the sales performance varies by region, which sub-categories drive the most revenue, and how the sales have changed over time. This allows us to make data-driven decisions and adjust our sales strategy accordingly.
